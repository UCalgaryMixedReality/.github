# UCalgary Mixed Reality

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **UCalgary Mixed Reality (UCXR)** ‚Äî a multidisciplinary student engineering team at the University of Calgary dedicated to building the future of immersive technology.

We **design, manufacture, and test** our own proprietary **augmented reality (AR) glasses**, while also expanding into **virtual reality (VR)** and **extended reality (XR)** development. All of our systems are developed in-house across four integrated sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, software, and biomedical.

## üöÄ What We Do

Our club is focused on the end-to-end creation of immersive systems. Here‚Äôs a look into each of our sub-teams:

- **üîß Mechanical Team**  
  Designs the headset‚Äôs enclosure, assembly, and mounting mechanisms. Performs structural and thermal simulations to ensure durability and comfort.

- **üîå Electrical Team**  
  Develops the full electronic stack ‚Äî including PCB design, power systems, and sensor interfacing ‚Äî to support low-latency interaction.

- **üíª Software Team**  
  Implements embedded software, computer vision algorithms, spatial mapping (SLAM), and hand-tracking pipelines. Bridges physical and virtual environments.

- **üß† Modelling & Research Team**  
  Creates interactive applications in Unity and Unreal Engine, explores novel tech like brain-computer interfaces, and builds tools for 3D anatomical visualization.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

We work across a broad range of technologies to bring our XR systems to life. Our stack includes:

- **C / C++** ‚Äì for embedded systems, low-level hardware interfacing (including 3d point cloud generation on depth cameras!), and performance-critical code.
- **Python** ‚Äì for prototyping, computer vision, data processing, and gesture recognition ML pipelines.
- **Unity (C#)** ‚Äì for developing immersive VR/AR applications and games.
- **Altium Designer** ‚Äì for PCB design and schematic development.

> üß† We believe in using the right tool for the right job ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs deploying SLAM in C++, training a neural net in Python, or prototyping VR games in Unity.

## üß† Featured Projects

We maintain a number of repositories. Some of our most active and foundational ones include:

- `UCXR-Engineering`:  
  Our central engineering repository, containing cross-team designs, planning docs, and integration tests.

- `Firmware`:  
  Low-level software and microcontroller code that powers the headset‚Äôs embedded systems.

- `Altium`:  
  Schematics and PCB designs for all headset subsystems.

- `Gesture-Recognition`:  
  ML-based computer vision pipelines to detect and classify hand gestures in real time.

- `ARmed-Website`:  
  Our club‚Äôs official website ‚Äî built and maintained by the software team.

- `Laval-Virtual Submissions`:
  Our club's projects that we develop in the Laval Virtual Reality Competition.
